# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

My change is that I will look for some Chinese classes to watch and then watch lecture videos.
Because of the language barrier, previewing in my native language in advance makes me feel that it is easier to understand

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

In terms of methods: It will be easier for me to apply some examples from the classroom as much as possible
In terms of application: I do feel that I should do practice exercises and extend knowledge, or redo the questions I have done before
In terms of attitude: Maybe I'm a bit slack and a bit tired after half a semester of study, but I should try my new methods to make
myself more energetic to face the new courses

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think what I did well was that I continuously listened to most of the lecture videos 
and took notes carefully in class or in the videos

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I might need to correct my procrastinating mindset because I have always wanted to do a comprehensive review for the final exam 
and to improve my professional skills, but I have never taken any action

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I still find the lecture videos very hard for me to stick to. Every week is extremely painful. 
It should be because of the language issue that makes it very difficult for me to understand. 

ðŸŒŸPerhaps summarizing one or more useful code cases for us every week, 
with detailed annotations and explanations, would be helpful. If there are any, I will definitely read them.
