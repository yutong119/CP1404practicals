# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

90% 
I watched the lectures in week1 and week2,
but didn't watch the content of version control because the teacher would
lead us to do it step by step in class. 
However, I'm still a little confused, so I will make up for it again.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

My practice class is on Friday. So I usually watch 1-2 videos on Monday evening, 
3-5 videos on Tuesday afternoon, and then 2-3 videos on Thursday afternoon. 
If the content is very simple, such as the lecture video in week1, 
I will finish watching it in one afternoon

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I insist on watching lecture videos and take notes. This is a good habit

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I think it should be being lazy. I will give up the extended practice questions, 
but actually I should do them

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I think it's because I tend to be overly nervous and anxious when asking the teacher some questions. 
This kind of mood can also lead to a decline in my listening efficiency

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Most of the questions have relatively clear thinking. 
Basically, you can directly write the code based on the questions
